# Schrodinger-Script
Some Script to run Schr√∂dinger jobs on HPC.
These scripts need to be run on the Linux cluster where Schrodinger is installed.

Vsgo
=====
A linux shell script to run Virual Screening WorkFlow for Schrodinger.

            Perform Virtual Screening Workflow.

            Usage: Vsgo [OPTION] <parameter>

            Example: Vsgo -i *.zip -D CBCF -s 10 -N 50

            Input parameter:
              -i	Gird file input.
                    Use a file name (Multiple files are wrapped in "", and split by ' ') or regular expression to represent your input Grid file, default is *.zip.

            VS control parameter:
              -D    Which databases do you want to screen? Default is CBCF. <CBCF>
                        CBCF SIAIS Chemdiv ZincLead HMDB HMDBmembrane Drugbank TCMD CNCL are Supported.
                        Different chemical libraries use different VS protocol. You usually do not need to change the settings specially.
              -d    Provide your own database path, the compounds files are recommended as maegz or SDF file format.
              -M    The maximum molecular weight your receptor can contain (usually your reference ligand +150) <550>
              -m    Set a minimum molecular weight to filter the ligands to be screened. <0>
              -o    Number of Output. Set how many ligand postures are output for visual screening. <2000>
                    This value usually depends on the size of the compound library. Note to adjust the value, otherwise you may not get the expected results.
              -R    Remove reactive compounds from the compound library. Default is flase, use this option will set it true.
              -r    Virtual screening is performed with only reactive compounds, and if you do not know what this option is talking about, use it with caution.
              -F    Use other options to pre filter compounds, which will open interactive Options.
              -s    Keep HTVS outpose to SP. This is usually a percentage. <20>
              -x    Keep HTVS outpose to XP. This is usually a percentage. <10>
              -E    Enhanced sampling was used in the XP to generate multiple conformations. Default is flase.
              -e    Enhanced sampling was used in the SP to acquire a more accurate conformation. Default is flase.
              -c    The number of conformations generated by each ligand in the final docking protocol. <1>

            Job control:
              -H	Hostname of your queue, defult is HPC_CPU.
              -N    The number of threads you want to use in this task. No more than 100.
              -S	Your Schrodinger path.
  

mdgo
=====
            A linux shell script to run MD job from a mae file by Desmond.

            Usage: mdgo [OPTION] <parameter>

            An automatic Desmond MD pipline.

            Example: mdgo -i *.mae -p K -t 200 -P "chain.name A" -L "chain.name C" -G HPC_gpu01 -n 1 -b cubic

            Input parameter:
              -i	Use a file name (Multiple files are wrapped in "", and split by ' ') or regular expression to represent your input file, default is *.mae.

            MD System parameter:
              -N	Do you want to use negative_ion to neutralize_system? 
                Defulat is no. if you use this option, your systems will be neutralize by nagative_ion.
              -b	Define a boxshape for your systems. <cubic>
              -s	Define a boxsize for your systems.  <15.0>
                for dodecahedron_hexagon and cubic, defulat is 15.0;
                for orthorhombic or triclinic box, defulat is [15.0 15.0 15.0];
                If you want use Orthorhombic or Triclinic box, your parameter should be like "15.0 15.0 15.0"

              -n	What nagative_ion do you want use to neutralize_system? <Cl>
                F, Cl, Br, I are predefined.

              -F	Define a force field to build your systems, If your system contain ligand or non-standard residues, OPLS_2005 is Necessary.
                OPLS_2005, S-OPLS, amber99SB-ILDN, amber03, amber99, amber99SB, charmm32, charmm36_lipids are recommended.

            Minimazation parameter:
              -m	Enter the maximum simulation time for the Brownian motion simulation, in ps. <100>

              -t    Enter the Molecular dynamics simulation time for the Brownian motion simulation, in ns. <100>
              -T    Specify the temperature to be used, in kelvin. <310>
              -R    Number of Repeat simulation with different random numbers. <1>
              -P    Define a ASL to protein, such as "chain.name A"
              -L    Define a ASL to ligand, such as "res.ptype UNK"
              -C    Set constraint to an ASL, such as "chain.name A AND backbone"
              -f    Set constraint force, default is 10.
              -o    Specify the approximate number of frames in the trajectory.  <1000>
                    This value is coupled with the recording interval for the trajectory and the simulation time: the number of frames times the trajectory recording interval is the total simulation time.
                    If you adjust the number of frames, the recording interval is modified.

            Job control:
              -H	Hostname of your queue, default is HPC_CPU.
              -G    GPU Host you wanna to use, default is  HPC_GPU.
              -D	Your Desmond path. <$Desmond>
